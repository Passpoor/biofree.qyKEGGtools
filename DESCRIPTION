Description: This package, biofree.qyKEGGtools, is explicitly designed to eliminate dependency on unstable online KEGG servers. It provides fast, reliable offline KEGG pathway enrichment analysis, resolving common network access issues that disrupt bioinformatics pipelines. The tool maintains data currency through automatic local database updates (via createKEGGdb), and is built for seamless integration with the clusterProfiler ecosystem. It supports comprehensive analysis for human (hsa) and mouse (mmu) genomes.
